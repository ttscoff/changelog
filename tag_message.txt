v1.0.5

## [1.0.5] - 2026-01-15

### Changed

- Date is automatically updated to current date when updating existing changelog entries
- Better handling of empty changelog entries when merging changes

### Fixed

- Prevent duplicate version entries when updating existing changelog entries

- Ensure keepachangelog links are always placed at the bottom of the file in correct version order
- Respect document order (ascending/descending) when inserting new changelog entries
